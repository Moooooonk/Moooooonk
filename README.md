- 👋 Hi, I’m @Moooooonk

- I'm an AI researcher who spends most of my time in an infinite while(true) loop. My life is basically a series of commits and rollbacks, sprinkled with occasional segmentation faults—you know, for character development.

I like to think of myself as a singleton, but my social skills are more like a race condition— unpredictable and occasionally crashing when two people talk to me at once. Debugging my life is kind of like chasing a null pointer, but I’ve accepted that some things are just out of scope.

My code style? A mix between refactoring and “it works, don’t touch it.” I tried switching to dark mode in life, but all it did was increase my coffee consumption and stack overflow visits. I often compile ideas faster than I compile code, but hey, at least CTRL+Z works in code (if only in life, too)!

Favorite exception: “Uncaught TypeError,” because honestly, aren’t we all just trying to catch the right type in this chaotic program we call existence?
