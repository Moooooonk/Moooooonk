- 👋 Hi, I’m @Moooooonk

I’m a college student eager to research AI. My days often pass like an infinite while(true) loop, but they’re filled with a passion for machine learning algorithms. Every weekend, I dive into coding challenges and explore new projects that ignite my curiosity.

Sometimes, I feel like my life is in an undefined behavior state, but even in those moments, I make sure not to forget to push new knowledge into my repository. My coding style is best described as “it works for now,” focusing more on the joy of debugging than on error messages.

My favorite error message is “segmentation fault” because it feels like a hint for solving life’s little problems. Each day, I strive to allocate new experiences and become a better researcher!
